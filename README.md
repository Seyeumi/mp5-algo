We have made an implementation of a 3 dimensional KD Tree


The time complexity of the functions:
- Contains: O(log *n*)
- Add: O(log *n*)
- Remove: O(log *n*)
- Find nearest neighbour: O(n^1-1/k)
- Creation with list of points: O(n*log *n*)

The Space complexity is: O(*n*)



We had issues finding a 'real life problem' that we wanted to solve so we decided to try and make an implementation of a KD Tree in 3 dimensions with the search functions, contains and find nearest neighbour.
